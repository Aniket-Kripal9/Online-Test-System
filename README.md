Project Overview

The Online Test System is structured around two primary user roles: students and administrators. Students access the system through a secure login, where they can take MCQ tests within a stipulated time frame (10 minutes). The test interface includes features such as question navigation (Previous/Next buttons), a countdown timer, and automatic submission upon timeout, ensuring a controlled and fair testing environment. Upon completion, students receive immediate feedback on their scores. Administrators, on the other hand, have access to a comprehensive dashboard that allows them to:

    • Manage student records (add, edit, delete student details such as roll number, name, class, course, and password).
    
    • Create and modify test questions (including question text, four answer options, and the correct option).
    
    • View test results for all students, enabling performance analysis.
    
The system employs a client-server architecture, where the client (web browser) interacts with the server to process requests and retrieve data. User authentication is session-based, ensuring that only authorized users access specific functionalities. The application is designed to be responsive, leveraging modern front-end frameworks to ensure compatibility across devices, such as desktops and tablets.

Technologies Used

The Online Test System is built using a robust stack of technologies to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability:

    • ASP.NET MVC (.NET 8.0): The project is developed using the ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, part of the .NET 8.0 ecosystem. MVC separates the application logic (Controller), data (Model), and user interface (View), promoting modularity and ease of maintenance. .NET 8.0, the latest version at the time of development, provides enhanced performance, modern APIs, and cross-platform support, making it an ideal choice for web applications.
    
    • ADO.NET: For database interactions, the system uses ADO.NET, a data access technology that allows direct execution of SQL queries.
